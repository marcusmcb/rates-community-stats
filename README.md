### Rate's Recaps

On the last Wednesday of each month, Rate Wonder, a DJ from Nashville, TN, does a community playlist stream on his Twitch channel where all of the music played during this stream is selected in advance by his viewers.

This is the source code for ratesrecaps.com, a website devoted to figuring out which viewers had the most songs played in each of Rate's community playlist streams on Twitch.
